# Linux_Automation_Projects
A collection of Linux automation scripts I tried to simplify and streamline system management tasks.

## system_health_monitor.sh
This Bash script monitors the health of your system by tracking key metrics like **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, and **disk space**. It sends **email alerts** if any metric exceeds a defined threshold and generates an **HTML report** containing system health details.
